Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning
This is a project that predicts the life expectancy of a person based on the given criterias
I have trained my model using multilinear regression
I used scikit learn package
Yellow brick for visualisation
I have achieved 85 % accuracy
I executed the same code in Watson studio and used the machine learning service in node-red and created a UI in it
I have also used AUTOAI to show the functioning and accuracy comparison between my model and AUTOAI
